# chatbox

This repo contains all of my standalone chatbox projects on SwitchCraft 3. Below is a description of what each of these commands did:

- \bal: Showed the balance of a Krist address
- \calc: Did math equations (Very much thrown together, but I made it because the other calculator never worked.)
- \snowflake: Showed information about Snowflake, my fake company on SwitchCraft.
- \timezones: Allowed users to share their timezones, and see timezone differences. It had a very rudimentary implementation of daylight savings time too!
- \top: This command showed the top commands on SwitchCraft. You can find a data dump of the final results [here](https://discord.com/channels/198130613759246337/1277642525401940064/1289469108626133013).
